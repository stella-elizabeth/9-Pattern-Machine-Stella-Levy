# Instructions  

This project is going to extend some of the ideas from the input-output projects. 

The interaction on the page goes like this:

1. When the page loads, you see two input boxes that accept numbers, a Submit button, and a third input box that allows the user to select a color.
2. Input numbers in the two boxes and hit submit.
3. A grid of boxes will be generated that match the selected color, with number of rows and columns set by the numbers you input.
4. If you change the color in the color input, then click on any box, it will change to that color.
5. If the "submit" button is clicked again, the grid of boxes will be regenerated with the current number of rows and columns and the current color selection.

First make a plan for your code -- what specifically will we have to do:

1. On the html file?
2. On the css file?
3. On the js file?

Write comments in the js file with a step by step of the things the code will have to do - don't worry at first about what commands will cause those things to happen, just say clearly what it will need to do.

What is the best way to handle creating a grid of boxes whose size isn't known, and which can change from user input?
